# Landing Page Project

This project is part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. It is a practice project to build a responsive landing page using HTML and CSS (including Flexbox) to apply and reinforce concepts learned in the foundations course.

## Project Overview

This landing page includes:
- A **Header** with a logo and navigation links
- A **Hero Section** with a main title, subtext, and a call-to-action button
- An **Information Section** with cards for displaying additional information
- A **Quote Section** to showcase a testimonial or quote
- A **Call-to-Action (CTA) Section** with a button encouraging further engagement
- A **Footer** with copyright information

The layout is fully responsive, using Flexbox for alignment and spacing. The design incorporates various sections that adapt to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the page.
- **CSS**: For styling the elements and implementing a responsive layout.
- **Flexbox**: Used extensively for layout and alignment of elements within the page.
